    <p>A little about me,</p>
    <p> I’m a self-motivated individual transitioning my information technology skills into front-end web development. My background in the IT field has made this transition smooth. Currently, I am learning through Teamtreehouse and learning a lot on my own.
      I love what I am doing and have been able to create webpages using HTML and CSS. My codes are created with the assistance of Atom and developer tools. In addition, I am able to utilize my skills in Adobe Photoshop to edit images and more. I have
      experience working independently and in a team environment while contributing my skills to see that deadlines are met in a timely manner. I am friendly, patient, respectful, thorough, and follow directions well. I’m also an excellent communicator.
